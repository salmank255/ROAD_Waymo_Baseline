## Devlopement
   - [x] implement building action tubes in python given frame label detection based on ICCV17 paper
   - [x] fill the gaps in genrated tubes;
   - [x] Write evaluation protocal for tube of all types;
   - [x] fix detection scaling, i.e. normlise the output of network to [0-1]
   - [x] write frameAP evaluation All 6
   - [] Generate tubes with marginals for duplexes and triplets
   - [x] add clssifcation for ego action classification for AV-actions
   - [x] frame-ap evaluation for AV-actions

## Fix annotations
   - [x] integrate last video from reza, video annotate by alex bruce but correction not complete.
   - [x] Redefine splits -  remove the video the shorter video from evaluation
   - [x] integrate last video from Andy
   - [x] Fix start and end of the interploated videos @12fps from old version of VOTT

## Experimentst
   - [] run experiment with different input sizes 
   - [x] run experiment with different network achtecture
   - [] see if we can accomodate RCN style YOLOv5 
   - [] check if giving information about anchor-location help in determining location better
    
# Major devlopments
    [x] accomdate multiple frames as inputs
